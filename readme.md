# Usage 

This guide assumes basic knowledge of command prompt or terminal and knowledge of how to execute Python scripts on your computer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Pandas Python Library is downloaded
> ðŸŽˆ If you have Pip installed, you can run `pip install pandas`


## General Usage
- Place the customer's customDictionarySource.csv file into the Source folder
- Execute "python main.py" if no header exists in the CSV file. "python main.py -headerExists" if one does.
>  ðŸŽˆ Since the provided sample CSV file contains a header row, the default example below includes the -headerExists flag

- The resulting "output.xml" file will appear in the Result folder
    - output.xml will be overwritten on next execution. Be sure to rename output.xml if you need to keep it.

- The contents of the XML file need to be copied and pasted into the appropriate template in the customer's site.
### Notes
- Duplicates are automatically removed. Duplicate terms are output as a CSV file in the Result file for reference.

## Examples

Default Run Command
```
python main.py -headerExists
```

Specific Source File
```
python main.py -source .\Source\customDictionarySource.csv
```

When providing a path on Windows, use the \ character to separate Path elements. 
On Mac or Linux, use the / character.

Use Most Recently Modified CSV File in Source, and Header Row Exists
```
python main.py -headerExists
```

Example Troubleshooting Command
```
python main.py -source .\Source\customDictionarySource.csv -bypassLangCheck -verbose
```
